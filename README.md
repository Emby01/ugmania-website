# ugmania-website
GItHub repository for the Ugmania website.

~~btw i gave up trying to make this. someone please tell me if there's an extension for vscode that allows html+css+js preview in remote repositories. thank you~~

didnt find an extension but i figured out how to get the preview by using the old-fashioned way, cloning the repo and pushing it to github
